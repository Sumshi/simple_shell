				SIMPLE SHELL
The C-shell is a re-invention of the wheel. It is based on the Thompson and Bourne shells and works in an almost simmilar manner.

Its usage is simmillar to the normal terminal and works, although not effectively for now but in a more simmilar way.

This project is based on C language and mostly covers what we have learned so far concering the C langage.

It is an extensive topic and mostly resonates around coding with a singke and simple structure.

			Usage:
 1. fork the Repo.
 2. gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
 3. Enjoy C-shell.

This code is under building. some features may be missing. 
The general built-in-functions are present. 
currently working o edge cases 


		THIS WAS DONE AS THE FINAL PROJECT FOR THE FIRST SPRINT IN ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROGRAM
